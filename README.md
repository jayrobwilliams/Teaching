# Teaching

This repository contains templates and scripts that I've found useful for teaching.

# Contents

- `PDFconv.sh`: This script converts a directory of Word documents to PDFs. It is
designed for a directory where each assignment is in a subdirectory, as it will
create a file in each directory called `wc.txt` with the document's word count.
- `Reference Letter.tex`: A template reference letter that include a university
logo to create a letterhead effect.
