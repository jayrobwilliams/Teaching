# Teaching

This repository contains templates and scripts that I've found useful for teaching.

# Contents

- `PDFconv`: This script converts a directory of Word documents to PDFs. It
will create a text file for each Word document called `<doctitle>-wc.txt` with the
document's word count. It also works recursively if Word documents are located
in multiple subdirectories. It depends on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for
conversion from `.docx` to `.pdf`.
- `PDFcount`: This script creates word count text files from PDFs.
- `Reference Letter.tex`: A template reference letter that includes a university
logo to create a letterhead effect.
